## Project Management

### Messaging Software

For communication we use Discord & Slack to have meetings as well as be able to have a direct line of messaging where a team member can ask questions about the project and other members can proved the answer in a quick manner.  

#### [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-au/downloads/windows "Download Slack") &  [Discord](https://discord.com/download "Download Discord")  

These messaging software were selected as we all already used them and all for efficient communication; which increases workflow & removes the need to meet in person. [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-au/downloads/windows "Download Slack")  & [Discord](https://discord.com/download "Download Discord")  are also important as it allows for the team to be able to send and receive important documents.  

### Workflow Management

#### [Trello](https://trello.com/b/qLl13NjG/cp3402-2022-1-site-team07 "Team07 Trello")  

To manage the Workflow of the project it was decided to use Trello. Trello is a popular, simple, and easy-to-use collaboration tool that enables you to organize projects and everything related to them into boards. Trello makes working through the project far more doable as it breaks down the tasks and members are able to mark off what has been down and what they are struggling with.  

## Version Control  

The purpose of version control is to allow software teams track changes to the code, while enhancing communication and collaboration between team members. Version control facilitates a continuous, simple way to develop software. Version control also allows looking at previous versions.  

### [GitHub](https://github.com/ "GitHub") & [VSCode- Github Plugin](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github "Download GitHub Plugin")

For the version control software, it was decided that Github would be used as it is the most commonly used version control software & all of the team members had experience using it.  

## Testing & Automation

The Purpose of Testing & Automation is to allow the team to be able to use a locally hosted environment to test code in an environment without causing changes on the live website. Automation is important as it allows for the production process to run as smoothly as possible for the developers.

### Local Environment

#### [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html "XAMPP")  

For the Local Environment [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html "XAMPP") was chosen to be used as the majority of team members had experience in using XAMPP and it is currently one of the easy to uses local hosting softwares on the market currently. XAMPP is a software package that includes all things you need to set up a local server environment on your computer. In order to create a local WordPress site, you need to set up a web server software (Apache), PHP, and MySQL on your computer.  

### Automation

#### [WP-Pusher](https://wppusher.com/ "WP-Pusher")  

The [WP-Pusher](https://wppusher.com/ "WP-Pusher") plugin lets you install and update WordPress themes and plugins, directly from GitHub. WP-Pusher automatic updates the plugin and theme automatically on every push. This means that when ever a push is made to the main branch of the GitHub Repository it will automatically update the live WP website. This greatly increases productivity while creating a WP website as it removes the need to manually update the website.
