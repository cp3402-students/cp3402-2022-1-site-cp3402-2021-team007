# Deployment
In order to make the deployment process streamlined this document was created in order to describe the deployment process in enough detail that a new team member or someone taking over the project could follow. To successfully develop theme updates locally, be able to test and deploy them to your staging and live sites.  

## Project Management

### Messaging Software
For commuication we use Discord & Slack to have meetings aswell as be able to have a direct line of messaging where a team member can ask questions about the project and other members can proved the answer in a quick manner. 
- [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-au/downloads/windows "Download Slack")
- [Discord](https://discord.com/download "Download Discord")  
These messaging software were selected as we all already used them and all for efficient commuincation; which increases workflow.  

### Workflow Management
[Trello](https://trello.com/b/qLl13NjG/cp3402-2022-1-site-team07 "Team07 Trello")
To manage the Workflow of the the project it was decided to use Trello. Trello is a popular, simple, and easy-to-use collaboration tool that enables you to organize projects and everything related to them into boards. Trello makes working through the project far more do-able as it breaks down the tasks and members are able to markoff what has been down and what they are struggling with. 



## Version Control  
The purpose of version control is to allow software teams track changes to the code, while enhancing communication and collaboration between team members. Version control facilitates a continuous, simple way to develop software. Verison control also allows looking at previous versions.  

For the version control software it was decided that Github would be used as it is the most commonly used version control software & all of the team members had exprience using it.

- [VSCode- Github Plugin](https://discord.com/download "Download GitHub Plugin")
