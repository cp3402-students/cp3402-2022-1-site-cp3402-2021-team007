## Features

### Bands

Bands can be added conveniently from WordPressâ€™s main left side menu to get an organised way to add and display your bands.

## Important Files

### Style.css

The CSS file is used to define styles for the web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

### Page.php

The Page.php is the template for the website as it holds all of the html within it that controls the layout of the pages.  

### Header & Footer

The footer utilises the Widgets in WordPress to allow the end user/client to add and customise content from social media links to the image gallery and more.

## Design Decisions

- **Target Audience** - The Target Audience of this website was everyone however the majority of its users are the elderly and therefore must be designed with simplicity in mind. Therefore the text must be large, the buttons must be big, finding the current events must be easy & the website should be easy to navigate.  
- **Colour** - The Colour scheme of the website has been design to revolve around the pre-existing Jazz Club's logo that is currently in use. This logo has Black, Gold & White in use and because of that it was decided to use those colours from the logo to create the websites theme.
