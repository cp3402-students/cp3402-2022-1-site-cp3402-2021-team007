#Design Selection

To allow all of the group members pitch all of there idea of the website it was decided that we would all create our own sperate designs. 
This allows for the team to be able to see everyones ideas.
With these designs we then used a combination to create the final design, that will later be used as the foundation for the WordPress Theme.
