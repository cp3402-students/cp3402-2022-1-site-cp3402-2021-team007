# Design Selection Process

## Design Process
To allow all of the group members pitch all of there idea of the website it was decided that we would all create our own sperate designs.  
This allows for the team to be able to see everyones ideas. Each member decided to create a design using a software of their choosing.  
This allowed the designs to be created the way each member wanted and what software they felt most comfortable using.

## Final Design Solution
With these designs we then used a combination to create the final design, that will later be used as the foundation for the WordPress theme.  
The final design we collectively agreed on using Storms Design however incorprating Nishans colour scheme as we believed it follow the colour scheme of the JazzClubs Pre-existing Logo.
